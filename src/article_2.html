			  	<h2>Saving Energy through Home Control</h2> 
			  	
			  	<hr>
			  	<h5 style="color:teal">By Mike Carrozzo</h5>
			  	
			  	<p>The connected home has been a goal for the collective homebuilding community for quite a few years now. Driven by increasing margins for homebuilders, and added comfort and convenience for homebuyers, the connected home is become more of a reality thanks in part to advancements in technology.<p>

				<p>For example, energy management remains a primary motivator for the connected home to some. The market recently witnessed two companies teaming up to offer new solutions, smart energy company Tendril, www.tendrilinc.com, Boulder, Colo., and Hitachi Communication Technologies America, www.hitachi-cta.com, Richardson, Texas. The companies announced they are working together to provide smart energy applications to consumers.</p>

				<p>These new applications will use set-top boxes, wireless gateways, and other home devices as platforms to enter the home. The Tendril Energize application suite delivers solutions for Web and mobile home energy management, and they will be available on the Hitachi SuperJ Applications Ecosystem, which is an open, Java-based platform. The companies say this will allow providers that are already in the home—such as telcos, cable companies, and carriers—to add Tendril Energize services to their existing smart home applications.</p>

 
				<p>Another name in home control recently picked up a new complement to its business. Belkin, www.belkin.com, Playa Vista, Calif., announced an agreement to acquire Cisco’s, www.cisco.com, San Jose, Calif., Home Networking Business Unit. Belkin provides a number of connected home solutions, including its WeMo line that allows consumers to control home devices from anywhere via mobile devices.</p>

				<p>The acquisition will provide Belkin with Cisco's Linksys brand of home networking products. The Linksys line could provide a platform for introducing more connected features into homes in the future.</p>

				<p>Will these types of technology advancements push more buyers to demand home control in their next home? Will builders find value in providing such solutions to the buyer? As the market comes back and technology remains a primary means for reducing energy in the home, some speculate the answers to both questions could be, yes.</p>
